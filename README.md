# Hi there, I'm Omkar 👋

I'm a developer with a passion for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and AI/ML-ops. I enjoy exploring data, building models and solving complex problems. I'm always eager to learn more about new technologies in the AI/ML space.


### 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently exploring the fields of **Generative AI**, **Agentic AI** and how to deploy them on Cloud (mainly **GCP**).
- 🌱 I’m deepening my knowledge of advanced machine learning techniques and how to deploy them on Google Cloud.
- 👩🏻‍💻 Using latest AI tools to learn new things and increase my productivity.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on open-source Gen AI - Agentic AI projects.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used my passion for football to write my Master's dissertation on data-driven football performance analysis!
